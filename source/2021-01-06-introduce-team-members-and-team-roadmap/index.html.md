### Upcoming exciting project on the roadmap:
The developer engagement team has been working hard to bring some exciting engineering tools and projects. 
1. Debugger for developers
On popular demand from the users of the platform, we are delivering a debugger tool for the platform api developers. We plan to release a beta version of this in the second quarter of 2021.
2. Genesys Cloud CLI
A beta version of command line interface will be released in the first quarter of 2021. Developers can use the cli to play around the api and learn how it behaves.
3. Developer Drops
The team has been putting together lightening talks that aim at briefly guiding the users of the api about any topic. These will serve as a starters to a new domain that developers want to dabble into.
4. Podcasts
Podcasts will be our informal and playful creative outlet to share about the Genesys cloud platform along with the philosophy and the culture within the company. 


Our team plays a unique role in helping the developers do their work effectively and creatively. We are a diverse group driven with a common goal to deliver high quality projects and help teams thrive.
We are looking forward to bring a wide spread of tools and technologies at your disposal!
