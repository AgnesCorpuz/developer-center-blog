There are other ways to create analytics queries but this is the simplest tool we can use to generate one. The Analytics Query Builder developer tool provides a user interface that simplifies the creation of analytics queries. You can choose the parameters and query type you want to use to generate the query but for this example we will be using user and conversation to fetch query for user and conversation details.

## Add data to the query

Add start and end dates for the query range.

## Standard user query result

This is a generated query for user. This is where you can find all the details about a user's activity during a specific date.
