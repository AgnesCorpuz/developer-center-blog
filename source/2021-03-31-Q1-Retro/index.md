Greetings everyone. I hope everyone is keeping safe and healthy in these challenging times. Wow! 2021 is flying by and the first quarter of the year is already in the bag. I wanted to take a moment and reflect on whats going on in the Developer Engagement team, what we have delivered so far this year and what you can plan to see over the rest of the year.

# We are growing as a team

Our senior leadership recognizes that one of the keys to a vibrant development platform is to have the right people in place to support the needs of a rapidly growing and ever changing development community. With the launch of the Developer Engagement team in Q2 of 2020, we have grown from a team of two engineers to a team of 5 full-time engineers and evangelists.  I would like to introduce our team and put some faces with the names you see posting on our forums:

We are still looking at growing the team beyond our current capacity. We are adding another 2 positions later this year. In addition, the Developer Engagement team now includes dedicated testing resources and technical writers to help improve the quality of our code and our documentation. We are extremely excited about the opportunity to build out a team that can support our growing development community.

# More Content
Our goal is to deliver timely, relevant, and consumable content for all the developers who use our site. We currently have 5 channels for delivering information about the Genesys Cloud development platform:

1. [__Developer Center__](https://developer.mypurecloud.com). Our developer center is the main portal for finding documentation around the Genesys Cloud APIs and development tools. It has a wide variety of topics dealing not only with the individual API calls, but also development guides on API integration, data integration, and Genesys Cloud development best practices. The developer center is the starting point for all developer content within Genesys Cloud.

2. [__Genesys Cloud Developer Blog__](/blog/). The blog contains articles on various Genesys Cloud development topics. It covers a wide range of topics, including new developer tool announcements, best practices for building your contact center within Genesys Cloud and hands-on articles on how to use the Genesys Cloud APIs.

3. [__DevDrops__](/video/devdrops/). Our DevDrop series is a new video series that we released this year. Its focus is on delivering short, consumable videos (10-20 minutes in length) that are meant to be "developer-to-developer" conversations around specific developer-related topics.

4. [__DevCasts__](/video/devcasts/). Our DevCasts are our more traditional Webinar topics that are approximately 45-60 minutes in lengths and allow for audience participation. They cover a wide variety of development topics and are not just limited to discussions related to platform APIs.

5. [__Blueprints__](/blueprints/). Blueprints are hands-on examples of how to integrate and extend Genesys Cloud functionality with other vendor products and technologies. Blueprints are meant to showcase the art of the possible.

# More Tools
The engineers in the Developer Engagement team have been heads down this quarter and have delivered several new capabilities. These new capabilities include:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|[Genesys Cloud CLI](/api/rest/command-line-interface/)|The Genesys Cloud CLI lets you perform administrative, ad-hoc queries and bulk changes from the command-line. Written in Go, it allows you to install the CLI as a single-binary (no dependencies) easily within Windows, Linux and OS X |
|[CLI Recipes](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/quick-hits-cli)|A GitHub repository containing recipes for the Genesys Cloud CLI|
|Developer Center V2|__Coming soon__. We are within weeks of delivering a new Developer Center experience that will include some new UI capabilities, the foundations for a better search and in many cases a new look and feel. |
|Logging capabilities|__Coming soon__. The SDK team has been building a more consistent logging experience across all of our SDKs so that developers can more easily (and consistently) log what is being executed in our SDKs. These new logging capabilities will make it easier for developers to provide the Developer Engagement and support teams more context when errors are encountered while coding with our SDKs.

# What's coming next
This is only the beginning of the year! For the rest of the year, the Developer Engagement team has a large number of projects in the works, including:

1. __More content__. This one is a given. We are committed to continually building out new content. In our content pipeline for this next quarter, we have new Developer Starting guides for integrating with the Genesys Cloud UI, a new Developer Starting guide for building Resilient Cloud integrations, and a new blueprint showing how to take the Genesys Cloud conversation model and map it to a relational database table. 

2. __A refresh on our developer tools__. Starting in Q2 of this year, the Developer Engagement team is refreshing our developer tools like the API Explorer and Analytics Query builder. Our goal is to make these tools easily embedded and accessible throughout the site. In addition, we are exploring how we can allow users to be able save their API calls and queries so they do not have to re-enter them every time they come back to the site.

3. __More value-added capabilities to the Platform SDKs__. We really want developers to use our SDKs more. So during the course of the year we are looking at introducing new features within the SDKs that will make life simpler for developers, including: consistent rate-limiting and retry-logic across all of our SDK platforms, adding the ability to auto-paginate API calls, and automatic re-authentication of expired OAuth2 tokens.

4. __More CLI capabilities__. The CLI was just released, but we are looking at how we can continue to thoughtfully expose our platform API in the CLI. We specifically want to focus on how we can more fully expose our Analytics and Edge APIs in the CLI.

4. __A more personalized experience in the Developer Center__. This one is really important to me. We want to allow developers to personalize the Developer Center to meet their individual needs. We are currently exploring how we can let developers subscribe to individual page notifications so they can be notified of the APIs that are important to them. We are also looking at building out a "favorites" capability so that the APIs you work with the most are available right at the beginning of the site rather then buried below multiple pages.

We are off to a busy year, but we are excited with the support and feedback we have been getting from the Genesys Cloud developer community. It's going to be an exciting year. Let's build something great together.
